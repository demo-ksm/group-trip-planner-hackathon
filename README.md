# group-trip-planner-hackathon

Problem
You are given a group of N travellers going on a D-day trip with H usable hours per day. You are also given a catalogue of A candidate activities and a chronological list of E real-world events that will interrupt the trip.

Definitions
Interest tags are drawn from the fixed set {ADVENTURE, CULTURE, FOOD, NATURE, SHOPPING, NIGHTLIFE}.
Each traveller has a daily budget (max spend per person per day), an energy level (0–100), and a non‑empty set of liked tags.
Each activity has a positive cost per person, an integer duration in hours, an integer energy cost, and exactly one tag.
An activity is eligible on day d if (a) it has not been chosen on a previous day, and (b) its tag is not weather-blocked on day d.
Feasibility Constraints (The "Fairness" Rules)
Before calculating scores, you must identify all possible subsets of eligible activities that satisfy three strict limits. These limits are "bottlenecked" by the most restricted member of the group:

Financial Fairness:
The total cost of the day's activities cannot exceed the daily budget of the traveler with the lowest budget.
Σ cost(a) ≤ min(u.budget for u in U)

Stamina Fairness:
The total energy cost cannot exceed the current energy level of the weakest (or most tired) active traveler.
Σ energy(a) ≤ min(u.energy for u in U)

Time Constraint:
The total hours spent on activities must fit within the fixed daily limit H.
Σ duration(a) ≤ H

The Objective: Satisfaction Score
The goal is to maximize the collective enjoyment of the group. The satisfaction score for a subset S is calculated as:

satisfaction(S) = Σ over a in S of |{ u ∈ U : tag(a) ∈ u.interests }|
In plain terms: For every activity in your proposed plan, count how many people in the group actually like that activity's category (tag). Sum these counts across all activities in the subset.

Example:
If you pick a "Hike" (NATURE) and 3 out of 5 travelers have NATURE in their interests, that activity adds 3 points to the day's satisfaction score.

The Decision Engine (Lexicographical Tie-Breaking)
Because multiple different combinations of activities might yield the same satisfaction or fit the same constraints, the problem requires a deterministic way to pick exactly one "best" subset. You must compare subsets using a tuple and pick the one that is "smallest" lexicographically:

Primary Priority (Satisfaction): Maximize the satisfaction score. (In the tuple, this is represented as -satisfaction because the rule seeks the "smallest" value, and a larger satisfaction becomes a smaller negative number).
Secondary Priority (Cost): If two subsets provide the same satisfaction, choose the one with the lower total cost.
Tertiary Priority (ID List): If satisfaction and cost are identical, sort the activity IDs in each subset and compare the lists. Choose the subset whose ID list comes first lexicographically (e.g., [1, 4] is smaller than [2, 3]).
Operational Logic
Rest Days: If no activities can fit the constraints, or if the "best" valid subset is an empty set, the day is designated as REST.
State Persistence: Once an activity is chosen for a day, it is removed from the "eligible" pool for all future days.
Replanning: Because events (like someone dropping out or a budget change) alter the constraints (min(u.budget) or min(u.energy)), the optimization must be re-run for all remaining days whenever an event occurs.
Example
Available Activities
ID	Tag	Cost	Energy	Duration	Interested Users	Points
A1	FOOD	$20	20	3	Alice, Bob	2
A2	NATURE	$25	30	4	Alice	1
A3	CULTURE	$30	40	4	Bob	1
Evaluating Possible Subsets (S):
Subset S	Total Cost	Total Energy	Total Duration	Feasible?	Satisfaction
{A1, A2}	$45	50	7	Yes	2 + 1 = 3
{A1, A3}	$50	60	7	Yes	2 + 1 = 3
{A2, A3}	`$55	70	8	No (Cost > $`50)	-
{A1, A2, A3}	$75	90	11	No (Exceeds all)	-
Applying the Lexicographical Rule
We compare the two feasible subsets, {A1, A2} and {A1, A3}:

Satisfaction: Both have a score of 3. (Tie)
Total Cost: {A1, A2} costs 50.
Decision: {A1, A2} is chosen because it is cheaper (50).
Result: The plan for the day is [A1, A2]. If no subsets were feasible (e.g., if all activities cost more than $50), the output would be REST.

Input Format

The input consists of several sections, each on its own line or group of lines. All values are separated by spaces.

N D H
<userLine>          × N
A
<activityLine>      × A
E
<eventLine>         × E
Where: - N is the number of travellers (3 ≤ N ≤ 10) - D is the number of days (1 ≤ D ≤ 7) - H is the number of usable hours per day (1 ≤ H ≤ 24) - Each <userLine> describes one traveller - A is the number of activities (1 ≤ A ≤ 20) - Each <activityLine> describes one activity - E is the number of events (0 ≤ E ≤ 20) - Each <eventLine> describes one event

WEATHER 2 ADVENTURE
This input describes a 3-person, 2-day trip with 8 hours per day, 4 activities, and 1 event (weather blocks ADVENTURE on day 2).

3   ≤ N ≤ 10
1   ≤ D ≤ 7
1   ≤ H ≤ 24
1   ≤ A ≤ 20
0   ≤ E ≤ 20

Names are alphanumeric strings without spaces.

Output Format

Print the initial plan first:

=== PLAN ===
Day 1: <ids ...>|REST | cost=<c> satisfaction=<s>
Day 2: ...
...
Day D: ...
Then, for each event in order (1-indexed), print:

=== EVENT <i>: <original event line verbatim> ===
Day <day>: ...
...
Day D: ...
Activity ids on a day line are printed in ascending order, separated by single spaces. Use the literal word REST when the chosen subset is empty. cost is the per-person cost for that day; satisfaction is the integer satisfaction score.

There must be no trailing whitespace and the file must end with a single newline.
